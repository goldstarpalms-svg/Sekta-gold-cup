# Setka Prediction App

Interactive Streamlit app for Setka Cup/table-tennis analysis, built from the uploaded Setka match-history CSV and leaderboard CSV.


## One-click Streamlit deploy

This repo is deploy-ready for Streamlit Community Cloud. Use this direct deploy link:

[![Deploy to Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/deploy?repository=https://github.com/goldstarpalms-svg/Sekta-gold-cup&branch=arena/019f9bb4-sekta-gold-cup&mainModule=app.py)

Deployment settings:

- Repository: `https://github.com/goldstarpalms-svg/Sekta-gold-cup`
- Branch: `arena/019f9bb4-sekta-gold-cup`
- Main file path: `app.py`
- Python: `3.11`

The app works without secrets for the included historical data. Add `THE_ODDS_API_KEY` only if you want the Live Odds page to call The Odds API.

It includes:

- transparent rule-blend prediction
- optional scikit-learn/XGBoost ML training
- live odds/API integration scaffolds
- a data-source/research registry for the resources collected during planning

## Main features

### Match Predictor

- Match winner probability
- Expected total points
- Total-points Over/Under probability
- First-set Over/Under probability, default line **18.5**
- Head-to-head summary
- Player comparison table

### ML Lab

Train four models from the historical match data:

1. Match winner classifier
2. First-set Over 18.5 classifier
3. Total-points regressor
4. First-set-points regressor

The ML pipeline uses chronological pre-match features:

- rolling Elo
- career win rate
- recent form
- first-set win tendency
- first-set Over 18.5 tendency
- point-difference history
- total-points history
- direct H2H history

The app can use:

- `xgboost` if installed and selected
- scikit-learn `HistGradientBoosting` fallback

### Live Odds page

Prepared integration for [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/):

- list available sports for your API key
- fetch odds for a chosen sport key
- flatten bookmaker/market/outcome odds into a table
- calculate implied probabilities for decimal or American odds
- export odds to CSV

Additional scaffold clients are included for:

- Pinnacle API
- Betfair API-NG

No API key is included. Add your own key through environment variables or Streamlit secrets.

### Data Sources page

The app includes a structured source registry for the links you provided:

- live scores and match history: Flashscore, SofaScore, LiveScore.in, BetExplorer, Scorebing
- betting odds: The Odds API, Pinnacle, Betfair
- table-tennis data: ITTF, World Table Tennis, TableTennis.Guide, Ratings Central
- ML: scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Optuna, SHAP
- analysis: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Plotly
- training: Colab, Kaggle
- GitHub/research discovery links

Compliance note: the app does **not** blindly scrape websites. Use official APIs, licensed feeds, permitted exports, or manual imports.

### Setka Cup official link

Includes the official Setka Cup website link:

- <https://tabletennis.setkacup.com/en/>

The app currently performs a lightweight availability/status check only. If you obtain an official Setka API/feed or have permission to scrape structured data, plug it into `src/setka_live.py`.

### Colab notebook

A Google Colab starter notebook is included:

```text
notebooks/Setka_ML_Training_Colab.ipynb
```

Use it to train models in Colab, download a `.joblib` model bundle, then place it in `models/`.

## Data currently included

- `data/Setka_June_2025_to_Now.csv`
  - 155,715 matches
  - date range: 2025-06-01 to 2026-07-24
  - score strings parsed into total points, first-set points, sets played, etc.
- `data/setka_leaderboard.csv`
  - leaderboard rows with Elo and match counts

## Run locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Add API keys

### Environment variables

```bash
export THE_ODDS_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export PINNACLE_USERNAME="your_username"
export PINNACLE_PASSWORD="your_password"
export BETFAIR_APP_KEY="your_app_key"
export BETFAIR_SESSION_TOKEN="your_session_token"
streamlit run app.py
```

### Streamlit secrets

Copy:

```text
.streamlit/secrets.toml.example
```

to:

```text
.streamlit/secrets.toml
```

Then set your keys. `secrets.toml` is ignored by Git and should not be committed.

## Train ML models from command line

Quick training with the latest 50,000 orientation rows:

```bash
python scripts/train_models.py --algorithm auto --max-training-rows 50000
```

Full training:

```bash
python scripts/train_models.py --algorithm auto --max-training-rows 0
```

Save path defaults to:

```text
models/setka_ml_bundle.joblib
```

Model artifacts are ignored by Git because they can be regenerated.

## Optional ML tools

Install optional ML/research libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-optional.txt
```

Tune the winner model with Optuna:

```bash
python scripts/tune_winner_model.py --algorithm sklearn --trials 50 --max-training-rows 50000
```

Heavy deep-learning frameworks are separated:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-deep-learning.txt
```

Recommended: install deep-learning frameworks only in Colab/Kaggle or a machine with enough disk/RAM.

## Use Google Colab

1. Push this project to GitHub.
2. Open `notebooks/Setka_ML_Training_Colab.ipynb` in Colab.
3. Change `REPO_URL` to your GitHub repo URL.
4. Run the notebook.
5. Download the trained `setka_ml_bundle.joblib` artifact if needed.
